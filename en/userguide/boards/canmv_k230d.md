# CanMV-K230D Development Board

## 1. Overview

The CanMV-K230D Zero development board is a collaborative design by Canaan Technology and the Banana Pi open-source hardware community. It features with the Kendryte K230D chip, equipped with a dual-core XuanTie C908 RISC-V CPU and an independently developed third-generation KPU (Neural Network Processing Unit). The board includes 128MB of LPDDR4 memory, providing robust support for high-performance local AI inference computing. With its comprehensive development resources and compact design, the CanMV-K230D Zero is well-suited for a wide range of DIY projects, AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things) devices, and embedded system applications. It is an ideal choice for programming education, AI-based audio and video innovation, and system performance evaluation, empowering users to embark on a journey of technological exploration.
